* weechat.el - Chat via Weechat in Emacs
  Please note: This README is just a placeholder.  A more detailed
  documentation will follow.

  weechat.el requires Emacs 24 and [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]].  For Emacs versions below 24.3
  you also need [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/cl-lib.html][cl-lib]].  WeeChat version 0.4.0 or newer is recommended!

  You can install both s and cl-lib via package.el (marmelade
  required):

  : M-x package-install RET s RET
  : M-x package-install RET cl-lib RET

** Usage
   First, setup the relay server in weechat.  Please refer to the
   [[http://www.weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#relay_weechat_protocol][manual]].

   To load and establish a connection:

   : (require 'weechat)
   : M-x weechat-connect

   To show a channel in Emacs, do:

   : C-u M-x weechat-switch-buffer

** Color settings
   Most colors in weechat.el come directly from WeeChat and are only
   translated into Emacs faces.  There are a few notable exceptions
   such as =weechat-highlight-face= or =weechat-nick-self-face=.

   If you are unsatisfied with the colors that WeeChat send then
   either change the corresponding color in WeeChat or customize
   =weechat-color-list=.  Do *not* add or remove any values in the
   list!  Simply change the value.  Using =rainbow-mode= (from GNU
   ELPA) or =list-colors-display= can help finding good values.

   The default configuration tries to match the WeeChat colors as
   close as possible.  Example for colors that go better with the
   Emacs' default theme are:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq weechat-color-list '(unspecified "black" "dim gray" "dark red" "red"
                                         "dark green" "green" "brown"
                                         "orange" "dark blue" "blue"
                                         "dark magenta" "magenta" "dark cyan"
                                         "royal blue" "dark gray" "gray"))
#+END_SRC
