* How to setup SSL
** Important Notes
   SSL support hasn't been verified by someone who has much experience
   with encryption. There's absolutely NO guarantee that the
   connection is secure.
   
** Generating the SSL Certificate for WeeChat
   Note: This guide is loosely based on http://frankkoehl.com/2012/02/create-self-signed-wildcard-ssl-certificate/
   
*** Generate the self-signed SSL Certificate:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      mkdir -p ~/.weechat/ssl
      cd ~/.weechat/ssl
      
      # Generate the secret key
      openssl genrsa 2048 > relay.key
      
      # Generate the public certificate
      # Enter your (sub)domain name for 'Common Name'. All other options are optional
      openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365 -key relay.key > relay.cert
      
      # Generate combined key/certificate file (this is the file weechat needs)
      cat relay.cert relay.key > relay.pem
    #+END_SRC
    
*** Reload the certificate in Weechat
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    /relay sslcertkey
    #+END_EXAMPLE
